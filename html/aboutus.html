		Spacely is a website that helps people who are interested in the Solar System learn more about it. This website provides brief and images of each planet with more easier information for younger people, especially students, to understand instead of going onto more complex websites with harder and more complicated information about each planet. Spacely will provide everyone what they need to know outside their imagination. Not only does this website help students, but they also help teachers to provide information that they need when they are looking for a good and simple understanding of the Solar System as a class lesson. This creates a great alternative when gathering information about space instead of a boring textbook.

		When I was at a young age, I didn’t know much about outer space until I saw on cartoon show about how the rocket launched into the spaces. I thought that was interesting and wondering what could there be outside the Earth. I started buying books about outer space also bought a telescope to try to see physical what’s out there. Then I started getting into space and how interesting it can be.

		During my early childhood, I was fascinated by the thought of the unknown. Staring into the night sky genuinely wondering what is what really is up there. Trying to find this information in 2007 was kinda difficult looking countless pdf articles about “how pluto is a planet” and stuff like that completely desensitized me from exploring the wonders about space. Yet this CNTRL-SHIFT competition kinda lit a flame inside me once again. Our goal on this website was to make it extremely user-friendly to satisfy these young minds.
